# C Assembler
This is a simple assembler made in C from Computer Science classes in UNESP.

All the commentaries were written in **PT-BR**, but I'll eventually translate them to **EN-US**.

### Usage:

In Command Prompt, at the "monta.c" directory, type:

  `monta <entry_file>`
  
Where **entry_file** is a *.asm*.

The output file will be a *.opc*.
