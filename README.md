# C Assembler
A simple assembler developed in C during one of the Computer Science courses in UNESP.

All the comments were written in **PT-BR**, but I'll eventually translate them to **EN-US**.

### Usage:

In Command Prompt, at the "monta.c" directory, type:

  `monta <entry_file>`
  
Where **entry_file** is a *.asm*.

The output file will be a *.opc*.
